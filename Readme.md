## Config

All config files must be in this folder. If there is no option to set this folder 
directly, it has to be hardlinked.

* `user_aliases.cmd`: aliases in cmd; called from vendor\init.bat; autocreated from
  `vendor\user_aliases.cmd.default`.
* `*.lua`: clink completions and prompt filters; autoloaded after all
  prompt filter and clink completions are initialized; add your own.
* `user_profile.{sh|cmd|ps1}`: startup files for bash|cmd|powershell tasks; called from their
  respective startup scripts in `vendor\`; autocreated from
  `vendor\user_profile.{sh|cmd|ps1}.default` on first start of such a task.
* `.history`: the current commandline history; autoupdated on close.
* `settings`: settings for readline; overwritten on update.
* `user-ConEmu.xml`: settings from ConEmu the UI of Cmder. ;
  Do not edit this file directly it is overwritten on each cmder.exe launch.
  
Environment:
   * To run the tests it is necessary to have the Eclicpse application and the git bash installed on the machine
   * The webdriver is already in the project making it not necessary to implement the path in the path
   * Create a folder and after entering the folder created click with the right button and click on "Git Bash Here"
   * After opening git bash give a "git clone https://github.com/Marcosfacjf/Inmetrics.git"
   * Open eclipse and click to import the project
   * With the project open you can now run the tests
